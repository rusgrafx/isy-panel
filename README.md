=ISY Panel= 

ISY Panel is a location-driven AJAX GUI system for ISY-99i home automation controller

The idea behind this project is to create a fairly flexible and expandable, location-based GUI system for ISY-99i home automation controller to drive LCD touch panels, iOS / Android devices, etc., throughout the house.


==HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS==

  * ISY-99i controller.
  * Some INSTEON modules to control lights and devices. 
  * Networking module for ISY-99i (ISY Panel is hosted *inside* ISY-99i)
  * Google Chrome browser support on your touch panels. ISY Panel may work just fine on other browsers, but Chrome provides ability to save web page as an Application (see menu Tools/Create application shortcuts...), which comes in handy.
  * Each device/panel on a local network should have static (reserved) IP address, either configured manually or assigned by DHCP.


==A BIT OF THE BACKGROUND==

A company named [http://universal-devices.com Universal Devices] manufacturers tiny, but smart, home automation controller called ISY-99i. The "i" in its name stands for [http://smarthome.com INSTEON] which is a dual-mesh (Power line + RF) home automation protocol which allows to remotely control devices and lights either plugged or wired in to control modules, switches, dimmers, etc. 

ISY-99i (later we will just call it "ISY") allows you to monitor status (ON/OFF state, brightness, etc.) of all devices in the home, as well as create advanced algorithms based on events, time of day, sensors, etc., to automatically control INSTEON modules. For example, ISY can automatically turn on the lamp when you enter a dark room, or it could turn off the porch lights at dawn, saving you money. The actual scenarios could be much more elaborate, though.

ISY controller provides advanced Java-based administrative interface for configuring your home automation network and programming the algorithms. 

It also has a basic web interface to control all configured (in ISY) devices from any computer or mobile device with a web browser. The key word in the previous sentence is "basic". The basic HTML user interface (UI) gets the job done just fine, but it's just a few white pages with tables and plain-looking buttons in them. Not so pretty. Fortunately, ISY provides a few technical pieces that allow third-party developers to create a nicer looking interfaces. There are a few very nice looking ones already on the market. Some of them target mobile devices (like iPhone or Android), some target large HDTV screens. But none of them provide the interface that is customized to a particular location (like Kitchen or Bedroom). This is where this project - ISY Panel - comes in.


==THE DESIGN IDEA==

Here's a quick quiz for you: Does it make much sense to you to show Master Bedroom controls in the Kitchen? Or showing webcam images of the room you are in right now? How about showing all the gazillion controls you might have in your home on your kid bedroom's touch panel?

If you answered "No" to at least one of the above questions then ISY Panel might be right for you.

==PROJECT STRUCTURE==

ISY Panel project consists of several files (htm, js, css, jpg, png). All these files should be uploaded to the same folder on your ISY. You can choose your own name for the folder, but I recommend to call it ISYPANEL (yes, in uppercase), that way it would be easier for you to remember what's inside that folder. All user files on ISY live under /USER/WEB folder, so you should upload all files to /USER/WEB/ISYPANEL. Then on your panels (or other devices) you will type http://{your_isy_address}/USER/WEB/ISYPANEL/panel.htm to access the UI. Just replace {your_isy_address} with the actual IP of your ISY-99i.

===ISY PANEL FILES===

Let's look at each file in the ISY Panel project. The files listed below are the core files that are required to run the project. You will have to customize and add your own styling for panels. For this task, familiarity with JavaScript and CSS will be extremely helpful.

  * config.js - This is the file that stores your panel(s) configuration - all your locations, links to web cameras, etc. It is one most important file of the project. The file that comes with ISY Panel is only for your reference. You would need to create your own *config.js*. More on this later.
  * jquery.js - This is jQuery library (http://jquery.com) that is used by main.js for AJAX and other functions. DO NOT TOUCH IT.
  * panel.htm - Main (and only) UI file. It has the backbones, the layout of the panel. The default one should work in most cases. Do not edit this file unless you know what you're doing and ready to face the consequences.
  * main.js - This is, well, main JS file that has all the logics to generate GUI from your configuration. Do not edit this file either.
  * panel.css - Main style sheet that defines the layout. No need to edit this too.
  * favicon.png - The icon that will appear in your browser's address bar. You can replace it with your own if you like, just keep the name.
  * Readme.txt - This file.
  
The following files are used to customize your panels. They are referenced from config.js and dynamically loaded when GUI is being generated. You can rename them, remove them or add more files. Every panel could have its own unique style (or they could share the same one). For example, you can create panels that match colors of your rooms to make the touch-screens blend in (never forget about the WAF!). Or you can make a playful panel with bright colored buttons and Winnie the Pooh in the background for your kid's room. Be creative!

  * styleXX.css - This file is referenced in `CONFIG.panels[i].css` attribute of *config.js*.
  * backgrXX.jpg - These are little tiles used in backgrounds of the panels. They are referenced by your CSS files.
  * camXX.jpg - These images are used at development time as placeholders for real camera snapshots. They make it easier to create styles for panels when you work offline. You can replace them with your own, just keep the names.
